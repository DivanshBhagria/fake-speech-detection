# fake-speech-detection
A hybrid Conv1D‑LSTM model on 26 acoustic features (MFCCs, chroma, spectral centroid, zero‑crossing rate) to distinguish real versus synthetic speech, achieving ~98.9% F1‑score and sub‑second real‑time inference through a Librosa‑based preprocessing and StandardScaler pipeline .
